### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer from London, who enjoys building user-friendly applications that help solve interesting problems.

I code in many different languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C# and PHP).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Foogle](https://github.com/lawcia/Foogle), this was my final project at futureproof. I am refactoring the project to include Redux for state management and updating the design.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop cloud based applications on AWS.
